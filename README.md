# http-dirlist-processing
script for taking an input list of http directory paths and generating an expanded list containing all iterations of them

The intent here is to allow you to take a list of http directory paths that you throw together (for instance, collected by spidering through a web app using Burp Suite) and then generate a more extensive list that you can use with dirsearch/dirbuster/other tools to do more comprehensive content discovery, probe for routing issues, etc.
